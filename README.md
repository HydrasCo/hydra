The open source Snowflake alternative. OLAP Postgres.

[Hydra](https://hydra.so/) is an open source data warehouse built on Postgres. It’s easy to use and designed for OLAP and HTAP workloads. Hydra serves analytical reporting with parallelized query execution and vectorization on columnar storage. Operational work and high-throughput transactions write to standard Postgres heap tables. All Postgres extensions, tools, and connectors work with Hydra.

Eliminate data silos today. Solve hard problems fast.

## ⏩ Quick Start

The Hydra [Docker image](https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra/pkgs/container/hydra) is a drop-in replacement for [postgres Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

You can also try out Hydra locally using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
git clone https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra && cd hydra
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
psql postgres://postgres:hydra@127.0.0.1:5432
```

### Or

Managed in the [cloud](https://hydra.so/).
