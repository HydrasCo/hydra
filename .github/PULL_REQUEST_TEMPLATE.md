Thanks for opening a pull request to Hydra! We've got a few requests to help us review contributions:

- Make sure that your title neatly summarizes the proposed changes.
- Provide a short overview of the change and the value it adds.
- Share an example to help us understand the change in user experience.
- Please make sure your code changes are covered with tests.
- In the case of new features or big changes, remember to adjust the documentation to reflect such features/changes.

Feel free to ping committers for the review!

<!-- Include an overview here -->

### What's changed?
<!-- 
Describe in detail what you've changed.

A code blurb is best. Changes to features should include an example that is executable by a new user.
If changing documentation, a link to a preview of the page is great.
